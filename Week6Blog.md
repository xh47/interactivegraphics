### Algorithmic Design Reflection

With regards to the control and structure of my piece, I am quite comfortable with letting go and letting my piece develop itself. The parameters involved with my mol class are position, speed, color, opacity, and size. Another important parameter is the mouse position which each ellipse gravitates towards at differing acceleration. My work originally did not involve interaction nor the random opacity - so while these updates are quite unexpected in design, I believe the piece still contains its original intended random aesthetic.
