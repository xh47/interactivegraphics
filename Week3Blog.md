### Hello World Task Reflection
Overall the Hello World task felt very informative and helped many of us in the class to develop a better understanding of front end coding. The artistic concept that I went with required much more planning than I anticipated. I enjoyed the thought process that was necessary. With regards to the pace of the classes, I believe we are moving along very well, although I could see some students struggling if this is their first time ever programming. One part that isnâ€™t quite clear to me is when to use html and when to use js for a certain design choice. Ultimately I had much fun developing my piece and am excited on what I can create further.
