### Art Piece 1
Pitch Interactive

Out of Sight, Out of Mind.

This is one of the coolest and most interesting uses of data I have seen - the drone strikes and their corresponding amount of deaths are displayed through drone strike visualizations along a year axis. You can then hover over the data and receive further information on a certain drone strike and the amount of people affected. From the visualization you can clearly see the negative impact of drone strikes. I think the color scheme and visualization in general is very well done, attractive, and gets the point across very well.




### Art Piece 2
Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi√©gas

Wind Map (2012)

This one is a really cool piece by Martin Wattenberg. Honestly I haven't seen someone try to visualize wind in current time and the wind map that they have created is not only artistic but gives you a general sense of the weather in the US! In addition the wind map is very accurate, especially during hurricanes! Screenshots of the wind map produce very interesting designs due to the comet-like trails implemented for the wind display. I really enjoyed learning more about this piece.
